1、Set `operationColumn = true` in columns as the operation column <br>
2、操作列默认左固定 <br>
3、The operation column supports row operations such as multiple row selection, whole row copying, whole row cutting, row position exchange (under development). This column function is similar to the operation column function of Excel<br>
4、The cells in the operation column are not allowed to be selected, edited, or automatically filled
